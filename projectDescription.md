Task Description:
Our company focused on a Niche website (single product category selling website). Currently, we are looking for a front-end web developer to build a full-stack website using React, Firebase, react-router, node, express, MongoDB, stripe, etc.

Website Purpose:

Make sure your design and website idea are unique. First, finalize your idea (what type of website you want to build). Then google the site design or visit ThemeForest to get your website idea. However, your website can not be related to your previous assignments or any demo project displayed in the course or in our conceptual sessions.

Initially, do not spend too much time thinking about the design. Just spend 30minutes to an hour. And then finalize the idea. Start working on the project. If needed, put a placeholder image and keep developing the functionalities. Once the functionality is done, come back to add proper images.

Task Detail:
The home page will have a header (simple navbar), banner, products, reviews, and footer. On the home page. Each product should have a relevant name, image, and short description. If a user clicks on the Card or Add cart icon it will take the user to the purchase page.

We will have another page on the top navigation bar (header) mentioning explore (you can give it a meaningful name based on your website). Clicking on the link will take the user to the explore page. On this page, users will see all the products you have. Each item will have a name, description, image, price, and button. Once a user clicks on this button, it will take the user to the purchase page.

The purchase page will be a private/protected route. Please make sure that if the user is not logged in, the private route redirects to the login page. After login, the user will be redirected to the page he/she wanted to go to. Also, make sure, that after reloading the page of a private route, the user is not redirected to the login page. The purchase page should display detailed information about the item the user has clicked somewhere at the top. It will also display the user's name and email address from the login system and the user will have a field to provide the address, phone number, and necessary information to place the order or to complete the purchase.

Implement email/ password (login/Register) based login system. The registration form should have the name and once a user is logged in, the user name and the logout button should appear on the header which will log out the user once clicked. Displaying the username on the header is optional. Please note that implementing the google login

If a user is logged in, he/she will see another option on the header is called Dashboard. Also, implement a Payment system.

On my orders page, the logged-in user will see only his/her orders. If the user wants, he/she should be able to cancel/delete any order. Ask for a confirmation message before deleting or canceling an item. Using browser confirmation dialog is ok.


If an admin logs in, he/she will not see the options that a normal user sees. Instead, an admin will see Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin, and Manage Products. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu items. Details about managing all orders or Managing products will be provided later.

An Admin should be able to make another user an admin. If an admin wants, he/she will be able to add a product on the add a product page. After adding the product, this product will appear on the explore page. Please note, to add an image for a new product, you can just upload the image on any image hosting sites like imgbb, etc., and then have an input field to add the link of the image.

For our testing purpose please add one admin with the email address: didar.a2255@gmail.com with password: didar125
